Super Interplanetary Space-Internet Saving Company Deluxe Task Force Adventure (SISISCDTFA)
===========================================================================================

SISISCDTFA is 22-level puzzle game developed with [PuzzleScript](http://www.puzzlescript.net/) in under 48 hours for [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com) 30 for the theme "Connected Worlds". You can play the game online [here](http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=05d5de73022687228b3a).

In it, you play as a space-technician tasked with ensuring the delivery of messages across the Galactic Interweb. Should you fail, the lack of cat videos across the universe will surely result in all-out war, or something like that.
